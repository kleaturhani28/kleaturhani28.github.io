This To-Do List application is built with Kotlin using Android Studio, following the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern. It offers a clean and efficient way to manage tasks with a user-friendly interface and robust functionality.

Key Features:

    Task Management: Add, edit, and delete tasks with ease. Each task can be marked as completed or pending.
    Persistent Storage: Tasks are stored persistently using Room Database, ensuring data is retained even after app restarts.
    Live Data: Utilizes LiveData to observe changes in the task list, providing real-time updates to the UI.
    ViewModel Integration: Employs ViewModel to handle UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, keeping the UI data separate from business logic.
    User Interface: Designed with a clean and intuitive interface that supports different screen sizes and orientations.
    Data Binding: Implemented data binding to streamline the UI updates and reduce boilerplate code.
    Search Functionality: Includes a search feature to filter tasks by keywords, enhancing usability.

    Kotlin: Modern programming language for Android development.
    Android Studio: The official IDE for Android development.
    MVVM Pattern: Ensures separation of concerns and a scalable architecture.
